- Exercise 1-13. Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words in its input. It is
easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging.
- Exercise 1-14. Write a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of different characters
in its input.
- Exercise 1-24. Write a program to check a C program for rudimentary syntax errors like
unmatched parentheses, brackets and braces. Don't forget about quotes, both single and
double, escape sequences, and comments. (This program is hard if you do it in full generality.)
